  "description": "There are several scenarios in which we'll want to query a list of data from the GraphQL server. Often times we don't want to query the entire set of data up front, but rather discrete sub-parts of the list, incrementally, usually in response to user input or other events. Querying a list of data in discrete parts is usually known as Pagination.",
